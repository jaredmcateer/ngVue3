### Minor Changes

- [`ed79cee`](https://github.com/jaredmcateer/ngVue3/commit/ed79cee087f1474ab5ee744d6ead97651c32e5cf) Thanks [@jaredmcateer](https://github.com/jaredmcateer)! - Initial release

  This is the what could be considered the MVP of ngVue, it contains the majority of primary functionality. A Vue3 component can be created in an Angular 1.x app, props are reactive, watch depths can be set, events can be listened to, attrs fall though.
